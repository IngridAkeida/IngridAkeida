### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ingrid Sanches. Welcome to my page!

**A little about my history:**

I have a degree in Administration. In my professional journey, I was able to have several experiences in the administrative area. 

**Now:**

Today in career transition because despite having a great experience in business I found myself in the Tech :star: world.

**A little list about myself:**

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a freelancer on some projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and React.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on any project, as my main goal is to always learn :heartbeat:.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love cats and horror movies, so my projects always have easter eggs related to both :wink:.
